Interactive Blogging Website Back-end

Welcome to the Interactive Blogging Website back-end, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Passport for user authentication. 
Separating the backend and frontend of a web application brings numerous benefits, such as enhanced maintainability, scalability, and development efficiency. 
The architecture fosters organization, flexibility, and adaptability as your app evolves. Check out the [live deployment](https://unusual-handbag-fly.cyclic.cloud/) for a preview.
